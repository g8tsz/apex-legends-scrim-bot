# Scores Archive Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Scores Archive match history view to use the modular Match Day Table components instead of the basic grid layout. This provides a much richer and more interactive experience for viewing historical match data.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Enhanced Component
- **Created**: `archive-match-history-enhanced.component.ts`
- **Purpose**: Replaces the basic grid-based match history with the full match day table experience
- **Features**: Inherits all match day table functionality including game indicators, expandable player stats, and overall standings

### 2. Data Adapter
- **Function**: `convertToMatchDayResults()` 
- **Purpose**: Converts archive data structure to match day table format
- **Features**:
  - Calculates placement points based on Nexus Scrims scoring system
  - Generates mock player data when not available
  - Preserves all original match information
  - Adds map names for better context

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Match Cards**: Beautiful card-based layout for each historical match
- **Match Headers**: Show season, division, match number, date, and participating teams
- **Full Table Experience**: Complete match day table with all features:
  - Game tabs with map names
  - Overall standings as default view
  - Game indicator circles with trophy colors
  - Expandable player statistics
  - Responsive design

### 4. Updated Integration
- **scores-archive.component.ts**: Updated to import the enhanced component
- **Mock Data**: Enhanced with map names for more realistic presentation
